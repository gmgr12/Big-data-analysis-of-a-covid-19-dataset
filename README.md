# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling with PySpark

This project leverages PySpark's MLlib and SQL capabilities to analyze a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset. It covers data pre-processing, exploration, and handling of missing values using PySpark. By utilizing SQL queries, we extract relevant data subsets to gain insights into key aspects of the pandemic, including:Geographical spread of total cases and deaths, Vaccination statistics, Reproduction rate and Excess mortality.
Additionally, we employ various machine learning algorithms using PySparkâ€™s MLlib for predictive analytics, such as predicting deaths, new cases, and total vaccinations. Finally, we analyze and compare the performance of these models across different numbers of nodes on Google Dataproc.
